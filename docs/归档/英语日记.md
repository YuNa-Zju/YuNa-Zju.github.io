This weekend,I visited Lin’an,a picturesque place in Hangzhou,with my parents. When we arrive in there,the host came out and welcomed us because we went there almost every summer vacation. In the following days,we played in the cold water in the stream and swam. By the way,my little sister who was just 4,5 years old also swam in the water with floaties on her arms. Back to the hotel,she couldn’t help giggling. What a nice day!
